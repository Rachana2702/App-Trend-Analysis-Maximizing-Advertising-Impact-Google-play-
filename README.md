### Conclusions
The dataset extracted from the Google Play Store has been analyzed to understand category trends beneficial for investors. Based on descriptive analysis and visualizations, the following insights have been drawn:

1. There are a total of 16 categories, with apps under the "Others" category being the maximum. Since these apps are a mixture of different types, it is challenging to conclude which specific type is trending. However, the second-best category, "Family," has the most number of apps.

2. The Family category is trending, as it contains free-to-use apps that support ads.

3. There is a significant difference in user engagement between free apps that support ads and those that do not.

4. Almost 80% of apps are rated for all age groups of users.

5. Ratings for apps do not show any significant effect based on the categorization of apps.

6. A higher number of reviews correlates with a higher number of installations for those apps.

7. Apps under the Family category, while costlier than others, still manage to receive good ratings, an optimum number of reviews, and installations.

8. It can be inferred that apps under the Family category are trending, alongside other categories like Games and Tools.

## Recommendations
1. The agency should focus on apps under the Family category for advertisements, as they are significantly trending in the market. Investment in other categories like Games and Tools should also be considered, as they contain trending apps.

2. Since most apps that support ads are free to use, the agency should prioritize investing in free apps rather than paid ones.

3. Investing in free apps under categories such as Finance and Medical should be avoided, as they typically do not support advertisements.

4. Given the high correlation between reviews and installations, the agency should target apps with a high number of reviews, as these apps are more likely to be installed.

5. The agency should refrain from investing in apps under the Business, Books, and References categories, as they are not preferred by users and have very low installation numbers, even when free to use.
